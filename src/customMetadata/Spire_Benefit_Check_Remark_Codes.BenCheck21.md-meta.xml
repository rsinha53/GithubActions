        <value xsi:type="xsd:string">MEDICARE IS YOUR PRIMARY COVERAGE FOR THIS SERVICE, BUT MEDICARE DID NOT PAY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ENROLLED IN MEDICARE OR YOU USED A PROVIDER WHO OPTED OUT OF OR DOES NOT ACCEPT MEDICARE. ACCORDING TO YOUR PLAN, WE PROCESSED THE CLAIM USING THE PROVIDER&apos;S BILLED CHARGE AS THE AMOUNT ALLOWED BOTH BY THE PLAN AND BY MEDICARE. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT MEDICARE WOULD HAVE PAID. BECAUSE MEDICARE WOULD PAY FIRST, YOUR BENEFIT FROM YOUR PLAN MAY BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE PLAN BENEFIT YOU WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HAD MEDICARE PAID YOUR CLAIM. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW THIS AMOUNT IS DETERMINED GO TO UHC.COM/LEGAL.</value>
