The decision to apply Physician\r\nspecialty society recommendations, the choice of expert and the determination of when to use any such expert\r\nopinion, shall be determined by us.\r\nWe develop and maintain clinical policies that describe the Generally Accepted Standards of Medical Practice\r\nscientific evidence, prevailing medical standards and clinical guidelines supporting our determinati ons regarding\r\nspecific services. These clinical policies (as developed by us and revised when needed), are available to Covered\r\nPersons through www.myuhc.com or the telephone number on your ID card.

(Two or more treatments are compared to each other, and the\r\npatient is not allowed to choose which treatment is received.)\r\nWell-conducted cohort studies from more than one institution. (Patients who receive study treatment are\r\ncompared to a group of patients who receive standard therapy. The comparison group must be nearly\r\nidentical to the study treatment group.)\r\nWe have a process by which we compile and review clinical evidence with respect to certain health care services.\r\nWe issue medical and drug policies that describe the clinical evidence available with respect to specific health\r\ncare services. These medical and drug policies are subject to change without prior notice. You can view these\r\npolicies at www.myuhc.com.\r\nPlease note:\r\nIf you have a life-threatening Sickness or condition (one that is likely to cause death within one year of the\r\nrequest for treatment) we may consider an otherwise Unproven Service to be a Covered Health Care Service\r\nfor that Sickness or condition. Prior to such a consideration, we must first establish that there is sufficient\r\nevidence to conclude that, even though unproven, the service has significant potential as an effective\r\ntreatment for that Sickness or condition.\r\n\r\nClinical Data: Clinical used for review.
